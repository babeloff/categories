# A repository for standard categories

This is an effort to revisit the notion of design patterns informed by category theory.
I suspect that what we thought of as design-patterns, aspects, and other concepts are better reprsented as categories.
As these concepts are specified as categories a categorical language will develop.
Once a significant quantity of these categories have been defined they will be used to bootstrap a categorical transaction log and database.
That database will provide the opportunity to revisit the tinkerpop3 api and reframe it in the context of categories rather than graphs.

## Standard Categories

From mathematics we have many standard categories.

## Model Categories

Domain specific categories.
