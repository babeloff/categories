The idea is that:
* each layer in a design is a category

We have the OSI layers
A design has a model for each layer.
There are functors between layers which compose to cross layers.
Each layer is also based on other categories.
To start with I will use the preorder.

There will be a mapping between the OSI layers and the TCP/IP layers.

The functors between these different layers and representations are adjunctions.
